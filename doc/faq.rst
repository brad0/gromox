FAQ
===

Q: Gromox sounds like Proxmox.

A: Gromox ([ˈɡɹɔ̝.mɔks], [ˈɡʁo.mɔks]): A made-up word that was chosen based on a
set of initial constraints: max. 3 syllables, preferably consonant–vowel
patterned, and the DNS domain must be available. It would be great if one or
more of the letters 'M', 'G', 'O', 'E'/'X' — because mail, groupware, office,
exchanging — could make an appearance. It is not meant as an acronym, but it
does lend itself to thoughts about interpreting something into it. On the topic
of lettercasing: just like Linux (the software) or Ottawa (the city), Gromox
falls into the category of proper nouns.


Q: Just how many of those protocols are actually implemented?

A: Enough to make most of the groupware functions usable in e.g. Outlook,
Thunderbird, Apple Mail and mobile devices. Conformance is always a moving
target as new protocol generations are introduced. At the same time,
Outlook/Exchange do not necessarily follow their very own specs at all times,
so we have to compromise.
