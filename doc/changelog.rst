Development 2.19.87
===================

Fixes:

* oxdisco: allow autodiscover for room/equipment stores
* oxcical: allday events are now emitted (pursuant to the
  ``oxcical_allday_ymd`` config directive) as "floating time" per the OXCICAL
  spec recommendations
* oxcical: resolve integer underflow that botched weekorder
  computation in weekly-recurring events
* oxcical: resolve out-of-bounds access during generation of iCal RDATE lines
* ews: avoid a heap-use-after-free during freebusy retrieval
* zcore: zs_getuserfreebusy had failed to resolve usernames
  and display freebusy status in the scheduling matrix view
* ldap_adaptor: resolve data race with double-free when per-organization LDAP
  settings were used

Enhancements:

* ews: improve calendar item coverage for mac calendar app
* all daemons: add various config directives to set file descriptor table
  limits
* zcore: add new error code and string for when the MAPI object handles have
  been exhausted by a user (as will normally happen when importing a
  multi-vCard/multi-iCal file with 400+ contacts/events, due to config
  directive ``zcore_max_obh_per_session``)

Behavioral changes:

* http: the file descriptor table limit is by default set to the environment
  hard limit (instead of 2256 fds, one will have 512K in Linux-systemd
  environments now)
* php_mapi: do not convert freebusy_event_details fields which are not available


Gromox 2.19 (2023-12-04)
========================

Fixes:

* exmdb: send "object created" notifications as search folders re-populate
* oxcmail: ignore zero-length From fields, which should help sending from
  Windows Mail
* Thunderbird/IMAP now picks up deletion events done by other clients
* imap placed eml files in the wrong spot.
  You may need to `mmv /var/lib/gromox/user/X/Y/eml1*
  /var/lib/gromox/user/X/Y/eml/1#1` for the various user directories.
* imap: the IMAP STATUS command did not cause any immediate response
* imap: announce EXPUNGE events on all typical commands
* imap: avoid double-reporting EXPUNGE events on EXPUNGE command
* http: resolve altnames and update user context after authentication success
  with krb
* ews: resolve crash during CreateItem RPC

Enhancements:

* `gromox-mbop emptyfld` now recognizes a `-t` option to limit deletion to
  messages of certain age.
* `gromox-mbop emptyfld` now recognizes a `--nuke-folders` option
* gromox-eml2mt now recognizes a `--mbox` option to support RFC4155 Unix mboxes
* exmdb: search pacing is now time-based, which should give more predictable
  interactivity during background searches
* emsmdb: do not treat the absence of the PR_LAST_MODIFICATION_TIME message
  property during ICS downloads as an error any longer

Behavioral changes:

* oxcmail: zero-length headers are ignored altogether (inspired by Alpine's
  behavior in that regard)
* daemons: repeal the allocation limiter function from source code;
  all "The buffer pool %s is full" messages should be gone now


Gromox 2.18 (2023-11-27)
========================

Fixes:

* exmdb: synthesized PR_RTF_COMPRESSED properties (in relation to the
  "dbg_synthesize_content" config directive) had an incomplete header

  message was deleted in g-web/Outlook
* http: RFC 7617 support for the Basic authentication header line
* nsp: allow connections from Windows with UTF-8 locale
* midb: removal of seqid renumbering, which speeds up
  IMAP SELECT/LIST/FETCH commands.

Gromox 2.17 (2023-11-11)
========================

Fixes:

* http: repair hanging communication with MAPI/RPC connections

* daemons: set umask such that created files have group write
  permissions for AAPI
* imap/midb_agent: fix a crash when some JSON files are empty
* midb: avoid a hang during the P-DTLU command when an eml/ file is absent
* mkprivate, mkdomain: repair wrong byte ordering in initial PR_CHANGE_KEYs

Enhancements:

* http: Windows SSO support via HTTP Negotiate authentication
* daemons: support for alternate login names
  (this allows for assigning shorter usernames for grommunio-web)
* exmdb: augment create_folder and movecopy_folder RPCs with a 32-bit error
  code, which allows g-web to better detect folders with duplicate names
* ews: implement Subscribe, Unsubscribe, GetEvents, GetUserPhoto
* mbop: add subcommand `clear-rwz` to clear out RuleOrganizer FAI messages

Behavioral changes:

* exmdb: the delivery_message RPC will now return with status "partial_write"
  if major parts of a message (body/attachments) could not be written
  (disk full/permission denied/etc.)
* delivery: partially-written messages now lead to bounce generation and
  emergency save action to disk


Gromox 2.16 (2023-10-29)
========================

Fixes:

* oxvcard: export to .vcf now positions the VERSION property in accordance with
  the vCard 4.0 specification.
* oxcmail: cease gratuitous RTF conversion of calendar items
* mysql_adaptor: a wrong string search was used for recipient delimiters,
  which could lead to Recipient Invalid/User Not Found

Enhancements:

  mailbox").
* emsmdb, zcore: the ``emsmdb_max_cxh_per_user``,
  ``emsmdb_max_obh_per_session`` and ``zcore_max_obh_per_session`` config
  directives can now be set to 0 for unlimited.


Gromox 2.15 (2023-10-18)
========================

Fixes:

* imap: do not emit continuation request on LITERAL+
  (now also for large literals >64K)
* exmdb: ignore softdeleted folders when validating new folder name
* exmdb: explicitly rollback SQLite transactions when the commit operation
  failed, to resolve cases of ``cannot start a transaction within a
  transaction``
* exmdb: ACE entries for anonymous were misreported to clients

Enhancements:

* delivery: support for plus-addresses/recipient delimiters,
  e.g. <user+extension@example.com>
* delivery: new config directive ``lda_recipient_delimiters``
* mbop: new subcommand ``recalc-size`` to recalculate store size

Changes:

* alias_resolve: config directives are no longer read from
  ``/etc/gromox/alias_resolve.cfg`` but now from ``/etc/gromox/gromox.cfg``
* oxcmail: do not emit Content-Disposition creation-time/modification-time
  parameters when those fields are not present in the MAPI object
* Delete unused columns and indexes from the ``associations`` MariaDB table;
  (grommunio-admin-api should be updated to >= 1.12)

Last-minute notes:

* When gromox-dbop attempts to upgrade to table schema version 127, an SQL
  query is issued to set a new PRIMARY KEY on a table. It has been brought to
  our attention that somewhat older MariaDB server versions (namely 10.4.13,
  10.4.22) contain a bug/not_implemented_feature which makes this query never
  succeed. The issue is resolved in MariaDB 10.6.15 (as used by the Grommunio
  Appliance) and newer versions. Details are still under investigation.

========================

Enhancements:

* emsmdb: eliminiate duplicate message appearing when copying to a
  private non-default / shared store

  property rather than as a flat file. The upgrade is automatically
  performed when the photo is modified via PHP-MAPI.

  nginx in front)
* mda: update "Received" headers in messages to look more like Postfix's
* pff2mt: --without-assoc is now the default
  (This is only a concern with .ost files, as .pst does not have FAI messages.)

  through an ACL now propagate it to the individuals in the mlist.

Fixes:

* imap: the response to the IDLE command had been malformed

  config directive is set to a non-zero value


Gromox 1.34 (2022-11-21)
========================

Enhancements:

* Daemons have a new log level directive (e.g. http_log_level, zcore_log_level,

  default LDAP.
* midb: resolve a startup crash in conjunction with musl libc.
* exmdb_provider: fix a buffer overrun in common_util_load_search_scopes
* lib: rectify return value of html_to_plain_boring.
  On systems without w3m installed, HTML-to-text conversion would
  produce garbage when the output was exactly 65001 bytes long.
* mod_cache: support continuation via `curl -C` and `wget -c`
* mod_cache: report errors with various 4xx and 5xx status codes rather than
  exclusively 404


1.33 (2022-10-20)
=================

* imap: rename `imap_force_starttls` config directive to `imap_force_tls` and
  `imap_support_starttls` to `imap_support_tls`, since it affects encryption as
  a whole, not just the STARTTLS command on the unencrypted port.
* pop3: rename the `pop3_force_stls` config directive to `pop3_force_tls` and
  `pop3_support_stls` to `pop3_support_tls`, since it affects encryption as a
  whole, not just the STLS command on the unencrypted port.

  and skipping 200 messages during the search operation
* exmdb_provider: speed up Online Mode searches by 14 to 18-fold
* mt2exm: avoid crash when an import message has no properties at all

Enhancements:

* exmdb_provider: add a config directive ``exmdb_search_pacing``

  `gromox-dscli`.


1.21 (2022-05-08)
=================

Fixes:

* lib: repair wrong propid for PR_IPM_PUBLIC_FOLDERS_ENTRYID
* exmdb_provider: avoid use-after-free crash related to Public Store read
  state username handling
* oxcmail: rework classification of S/MIME mails
* email_lib: make ICAL_TIME::twcompare behave symmetrically
* oxcical: appointments were prone to being in the wrong timezone due to

* exmdb_provider: add "exmdb_pf_read_per_user" config directive
* imap: add directive "imap_cmd_debug"

Changes:

* zcore: return ecNotFound from mapi_getstoreentryid when unable to resolve user


1.20 (2022-04-30)
=================

Fixes:

* Resolve a use-after-free in gromox-eml2mt
* oxcmail: conversion of Reply-To MAPI field to Internet Mail had only used the last
  ONEOFF-type recipient, now it uses all ONEOFF recipients.
* oxcmail: set IPM.Note.SMIME.MultipartSigned only for incoming S/MIME mails,
  not for OpenPGP mails.
* autodiscover: Change the way autodiscover.ini is parsed. This allows a few
  more non-alphanumeric characters in the MariaDB password. ';' is still
  unusable.
* exmdb_provider: Evaluate restrictions against absent values differently;
  this makes messages without a sensitivity tag and which are located
  in a non-default store visible in Outlook again.
* pop3: SIGHUP now really reloads pop3_cmd_debug from the .cfg file

Changes:

* zcore: entryids for PAB entries now follow the ZCSAB entryid scheme

  database schemas
* mbop: new utility
* rebuild: added progress indicator
* zcore: new config directive "zcore_max_obh_per_session"
* emsmdb: new config directives "emsmdb_max_obh_per_session",
  "emsmdb_max_cxh_per_user" to allow higher resource use when a lot of stores
  are used by an Outlook profile (warning W-1580).

Fixes:

* emsmdb: no longer send folder named properties in ICS streams
* mapi_lib: resolve use-after-free in idset::remove
* http: cure a crash in pdu_processor_auth_bind_ack when NTLMSSP authentication
  is attempted
* exmdb_client: when the exmdb server is not reachable, fail immediately rather
  than timeout
* Change SQLite db schema to use BLOB column type/affinity instead of NONE,
  resolving an unwanted auto-conversion from certain strings that look like
  numbers, e.g. E.164 telephone numbers without spaces.
* lib: add missing RFC 2047 Base64 recognition to some mail functions
* lib: autodetect iso-2022-jp-ms (un)availability in iconv to resolve
  conversion problems with RFC 2047 encoded-words using iso-2022-jp

Behavioral changes:

* rebuild: no longer performs implicit schema updates; see
  gromox-mkprivate/mkpublic/mkmidb -U, or the exmdb_schema_upgrades directive
  for replacement.
* rebuild: no longer performs db unload/reload; this operation moved to
  gromox-mbop.
* zcore: move socket creation after privilege drop


1.18 (2022-03-19)

* exmdb_provider: New config directive "sqlite_debug" for enabling analysis of
  all SQLite queries made.
* nsp: New config directive "nsp_trace" for enabling analysis of (some)
  NSPI RPC calls and their parameters.

Fixes:

* exmdb_provider: Abort asynchronous search folder population when the very
  search folder has been closed.
* exmdb_providier: do not close idle databases that still have active
  notification listeners
* nsp: Fix janky row seeking and crashing when using the name search feature in
  Outlook's Address Book dialog.
* mysql_adaptor: Lookup of rooms and equipment by maildir has been restored.
* midb had erroneously processed only the first command for every network read
* exmdb_client again groups notify connections per PID

Changes:

* nsp: When performing a name search in Outlook's Address Book dialog,
  scan the entire table rather than just the entries from the currently
  highlighted line forwards.


1.17 (2022-03-09)
=================

Enhancements:

* emsmdb: Faststream temporary state files are now written to
  /var/tmp/gromox instead and with O_TMPFILE, because they need not
  be persisted at all, and if /var/lib/gromox is a network filesystem,
  the network roundtrip can be eliminated.
* exmdb_provider: emit a log message when host not in exmdb_acl
* ldap_adaptor: add a "ldap_edirectory_workarounds" config directive
* zcore: user settings are saved to disk much more rapidly now
  (Settings could get lost when zcore terminated unexpectedly because
  of very long caching periods.)
* zcore: allow reducing zarafa_threads_num directive to a minimum of 1

Fixes:

* oxcmail: conversion of recurring meeting requests from MAPI to IM/RFC5322
  misconstructed the exmdb RPC for querying PidLidTimeZoneStruct,
  likely failing the export as a whole.
* exmdb_provider: avoid a SQL query error when placing a new message
  into public folder
* exmdb_provider: delete W-1595/W-1596 false positive warning
* exmdb_provider: avoid giving a negative/wrapped unread message count for
  folders (PR_CONTENT_UNREAD)
* exmdb_provider: the presence of PR_PARENT_DISPLAY (normally a computed property)
  in the sqlite db (hence not computed) had caused the READ_MESSAGE RPC to fail
* kdb2mt: skip importing PR_PARENT_DISPLAY
* kdb2mt: skip importing PR_ACL_DATA, PR_RULES_DATA, PR_EC_WEBACCESS_SETTINGS_JSON
  (has KC-specific entryids that have no meaning when in Gromox)
* zcore: cure an out-of-bounds access in
  container_object_get_user_table_all_proptags
* zcore: fix mis-setting of the internal/external OOF message
* mkmidb: fix a startup crash (add missing CFG_TABLE_END marker)
* authmgr: zero-terminate reason string

Known issues:

* emsmdb: Moving a message from one store to another in Cached Mode
  is rejected; a new message "E-1664: message has GUID of another
  store, cannot import" is produced until implemented.
